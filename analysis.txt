predicted vs actual cdf
different state representations
performance with quantile_thresholds limited to approximately 50%
performance with 0->n quantiles
sawtooth vs cosine performance
exploration differences: linear decreasing vs up and down
behavior with quantile quantile_thresholds limited to small ranges, but stepping from 0 -> 100%
