This implementation was run using an ubuntu installation.

Install the latest version of open ai gym, including the box2d environment.
This was run on tensorflow 1.13.1, but might run on a newer version of tensorflow (hasn't been tried)
You will also need matplotlib 3.1.0 and numpy 1.17.0

The program is executed by running the file "train.py," which will train a new agent from scratch.
